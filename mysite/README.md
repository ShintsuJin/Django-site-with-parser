# My first django site with parser
+ ### Description:
    This site has a **parser** which parsing some data from this [site](https://mignews.com/), after that **parser** sends data by post requests to rest-API.
    Rest-API *serializes* that data and displays news on site in category 'parser'.
    So you can run that script which has named 'parser' and it'll be work.
>**P.S: If you are from Russia, unfortunately, you have to use VPN before run parser, otherwise it won't work, due to site was blocked**
